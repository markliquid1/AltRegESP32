Folder descriptions:

Regulator Programs ----- contains drafts of the code to run on ESP32.  Choose the newest .INO for most complete functionality.  This is the one that goes onto the ESP32/ESPDuino.  Also needed is the newest HTML file, which must be uploaded to ESP32's LittleFS (flash memory).  Tutorial was here: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp32-littlefs/#installing-MAC  but is likely to become a broken link soon.  Best bet is to google "how to upload files to ESP32 Littel FS" and use the latest and greatest methods.

ComponentDebuggingNotes ------  smaller programs that were used for debugging specific features- probably not of any use to anyone.
